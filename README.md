ProjectIrrationalMondriaan
==========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of what I could do with the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

===========================

This project is a spawn of --> [ProjectIrrationalMondriaan](https://github.com/DeRaafMedia/ProjectIrrationalMondriaan). Where you can read a full description.

(This specific painitng is "touch" reactive (viewer needs to punch the painting for an effect). The "hit array" is the part that stays white in the middle (I wouldn't dare to call it a square) on way how this punch reactivness could be achiefed is draw below. This is the way I did it 6 years ago as a quick an dirty test, there are far beter ways of doing this).

(provided here is an Arduino sketch that allows for four buttons to be connected to test this painting instead of a reactive screen. [example]())

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)

A short description on how to install this software can be found in this projects [wiki](https://github.com/DeRaafMedia/ProjectIrrationalMondriaan-Composition-No-1--Lozenge-with-four-lines-/wiki)
